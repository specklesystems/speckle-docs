# Public Functions in Speckle Automate

## What Are Public Functions?

Public functions are reusable, pre-defined operations available to all Speckle Automate users. They are designed to be simple yet powerful, focusing on specific, high-utility use cases. They help streamline workflows without requiring custom development.

Public functions are ideal for:

- Automating repetitive tasks.  
- Solving well-defined problems efficiently.  
- Providing quick-start solutions for everyday automation needs.  

## Curated by Speckle

At the start of the public beta, all public functions are curated and developed by Speckle to ensure reliability, simplicity, and quality. Later in the beta, we plan to expand this ecosystem by promoting:

- **Community Contributions**: Functions designed and shared by Speckle users.  
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Functions tailored to specific use cases, such as connecting with SaaS platforms.

The goal is to create a collaborative and diverse library of functions that address a wide range of automation scenarios.

## How to Access Public Functions

Public functions are accessible through the **Functions Library**, located in the Automations tab of your project.

In the library, you can:

1. Browse available public functions.  
2. Review descriptions to understand their purpose and parameters.  
3. Select a function to include in your automation.

## Using Public Functions

To use a public function in your workflow, follow the steps outlined in the [Creating Automations](./create-automation.html) page. This guide will walk you through:

1. Selecting a public function.  
2. Configuring its parameters.  
3. Assigning it to a model in your project.  

Refer to the automation pages for details on managing automations and updating configurations as needed.

## Examples of Public Functions

Here are some examples of public functions that offer high utility for common tasks:

- **Render Image**: Produces high-quality rendered images of models.  
- **Data Validator**: Ensures model data meets predefined standards.  
- **Report Generator**: Compiles key information from a model into a structured PDF report.  
- **Export GLTF**: Converts models into GLTF format for seamless 3D viewing.

## Updates to Public Functions

Their authors maintain Public functions and update them to improve functionality or address issues. When a new version of a public function is released:

- Existing automations using the function will not update automatically.  
- You can manually update your automation to use the latest version. For guidance, refer to the [Update an Automation](./update-automation.html) page.

## Benefits of Public Functions

- **Simple and Focused**: Designed for tightly defined use cases that deliver real value.  
- **Accessible**: No need for custom code; just configure and automate.  
- **Collaborative**: Leverage improvements from Speckle, the community, and third-party developers.  
- **Efficient**: Save time with pre-configured, reliable workflows.

Public functions empower you to tackle specific challenges easily, offering a straightforward entry point to Speckle Automate's power.
