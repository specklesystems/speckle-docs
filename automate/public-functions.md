# Premade Automations

## What Are Premade automations?

Premade Automations are reusable, pre-defined operations designed to help all Speckle Automate users streamline their workflows without needing custom development. They focus on specific, high-utility use cases and offer simplicity and efficiency.

Premade automations will be ideal for:

- Automating repetitive tasks.  
- Solving well-defined problems efficiently.  
- Providing quick-start solutions for everyday automation needs.  

## Curated by Speckle

Premade automations are planned for release soon. When introduced, Speckle will curate and develop all Premade automations to ensure reliability, simplicity, and quality. Over time, the ecosystem will grow to include:

- **Community Contributions**: Functions designed and shared by Speckle users.  
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Functions tailored to specific use cases, such as connecting with SaaS platforms.

The goal is to create a collaborative and diverse library of functions that address a wide range of automation scenarios.

## Accessing Premade automations

Once released, Premade automations will be accessible through the **Functions Library** in the Automations tab of your project.  

In the library, you will be able to:

1. Browse available Premade automations.  
2. Review descriptions to understand their purpose and parameters.  
3. Select a function to include in your automation.

## Using Premade automations

To use a Premade automation, you'll follow these steps (available after release):

1. Select a Premade automation.  
2. Configure its parameters.  
3. Assign it to a model in your project.  

The [Creating Automations](./create-automation.md) page will provide detailed guidance on creating automation and configuring functions.

## Planned Examples of Premade automations

Here are examples of Premade automations planned for release:

- **Render Image**: Produces high-quality rendered images of models.  
- **Data Validator**: Ensures model data meets predefined standards.  
- **Report Generator**: Compiles key information from a model into a structured PDF report.  
- **Export GLTF**: Converts models into GLTF format for seamless 3D viewing.

## Updates to Premade automations

Speckle will maintain and update Premade automations to improve functionality or address issues. When a new version of a Premade automation is released:

- Existing automations using the function will not update automatically.  
- Manual updates can be applied following the [Update an Automation](./update-automation.md) guide.

## Benefits of Premade automations

- **Simple and Focused**: Designed for tightly defined use cases that deliver real value.  
- **Accessible**: No need for custom code; just configure and automate.  
- **Collaborative**: Leverage improvements from Speckle, the community, and third-party developers.  
- **Efficient**: Save time with pre-configured, reliable workflows.

Premade automations aim to empower users to tackle specific challenges easily, providing a straightforward entry point to Speckle Automate's capabilities.
