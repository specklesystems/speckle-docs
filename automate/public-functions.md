# Public Functions (Coming Soon)

## What Are Public Functions?

Public functions are reusable, pre-defined operations designed to help all Speckle Automate users streamline their workflows without needing custom development. They focus on specific, high-utility use cases and offer simplicity and efficiency.

Public functions will be ideal for:

- Automating repetitive tasks.  
- Solving well-defined problems efficiently.  
- Providing quick-start solutions for everyday automation needs.  

## Curated by Speckle

Public functions are planned for release soon. When introduced, Speckle will curate and develop all public functions to ensure reliability, simplicity, and quality. Over time, the ecosystem will grow to include:

- **Community Contributions**: Functions designed and shared by Speckle users.  
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Functions tailored to specific use cases, such as connecting with SaaS platforms.

The goal is to create a collaborative and diverse library of functions that address a wide range of automation scenarios.

## Accessing Public Functions

Once released, public functions will be accessible through the **Functions Library** in the Automations tab of your project.  

In the library, you will be able to:

1. Browse available public functions.  
2. Review descriptions to understand their purpose and parameters.  
3. Select a function to include in your automation.

## Using Public Functions

To use a public function, you'll follow these steps (available after release):

1. Select a public function.  
2. Configure its parameters.  
3. Assign it to a model in your project.  

The [Creating Automations](./create-automation.md) page will provide detailed guidance on creating automation and configuring functions.

## Planned Examples of Public Functions

Here are examples of public functions planned for release:

- **Render Image**: Produces high-quality rendered images of models.  
- **Data Validator**: Ensures model data meets predefined standards.  
- **Report Generator**: Compiles key information from a model into a structured PDF report.  
- **Export GLTF**: Converts models into GLTF format for seamless 3D viewing.

## Updates to Public Functions

Speckle will maintain and update public functions to improve functionality or address issues. When a new version of a public function is released:

- Existing automations using the function will not update automatically.  
- Manual updates can be applied following the [Update an Automation](./update-automation.md) guide.

## Benefits of Public Functions

- **Simple and Focused**: Designed for tightly defined use cases that deliver real value.  
- **Accessible**: No need for custom code; just configure and automate.  
- **Collaborative**: Leverage improvements from Speckle, the community, and third-party developers.  
- **Efficient**: Save time with pre-configured, reliable workflows.

Public functions aim to empower users to tackle specific challenges easily, providing a straightforward entry point to Speckle Automate's capabilities.
