# Public Functions in Speckle Automate

## What Are Public Functions?

Public functions are reusable, pre-defined operations available to all users of Speckle Automate. They are created and maintained by the Speckle team or the community, designed to streamline common workflows and tasks.

Public functions are ideal for:

- Automating repetitive tasks.
- Leveraging community-developed solutions.
- Quick-starting automations without needing custom code.

## Curated by Speckle

At the start of the public beta, all public functions are curated and developed by Speckle to ensure reliability and quality. Later in the beta, we plan to explore promoting functions created by the community and third parties. This includes:

- **Community Contributions**: Functions designed and shared by Speckle users.  
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Functions developed for specific use cases, such as integrations with SaaS platforms.

Our goal is to build a robust and collaborative ecosystem of public functions to support diverse automation needs.

## How to Access Public Functions

Public functions are accessible through the **Functions Library**, found in the Automations tab of your project.

In the library, you can:

1. Browse available public functions.  
2. Review descriptions to understand their purpose and parameters.  
3. Select a function to include in your automation.

## Using Public Functions

To use a public function in your workflow, follow the steps outlined in the [Creating Automations](./create-automation.html) page. This guide will walk you through:

1. Selecting a public function.  
2. Configuring its parameters.  
3. Assigning it to a model in your project.  

Refer back to the automation pages for details on managing automations and editing configurations as needed.

## Examples of Public Functions

Here are some examples of public functions you might find:

- **Render Image**: Creates a high-quality rendered image of a model.  
- **Data Validator**: Checks model data for compliance with predefined standards.  
- **Report Generator**: Generates a PDF report summarising key information from a model.  
- **Export GLTF**: Converts a model into a GLTF format for 3D viewing.

## Updates to Public Functions

Public functions are maintained by their authors and updated regularly to improve functionality or fix issues. When a new version of a public function is released:

- Existing automations using the function will not be automatically updated.
- You will need to manually update the automation to use the new version, if desired. Refer to the [Update an Automation](./update-automation.html) page for instructions.

## Benefits of Public Functions

- **Accessibility**: No need to write custom code; use ready-made solutions.  
- **Collaboration**: Benefit from community-driven improvements and feedback.  
- **Efficiency**: Reduce setup time with pre-configured, battle-tested workflows.

Public functions provide a powerful, accessible way to automate tasks in Speckle without the complexity of custom development. Start exploring the library today!
