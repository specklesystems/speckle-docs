# Testing Your Functions

Speckle Automate supports robust testing for your functions through local testing setups and **test automations**â€”sandbox environments designed to validate your function's business logic and results against real project data.

## What Are Test Automations?

Test automations provide a safe, sandboxed environment for function authors to:

1. Test how a functionâ€™s business logic interacts with Speckle project data.
2. Validate that the function produces the desired results.

Unlike regular automations, test automations:
- Are not triggered by project data changes.
- Cannot be manually triggered via the UI.
- Do not execute published functions directly, but allow you to run your function locally while connecting to Speckle data.

## How to Create a Test Automation

1. Navigate to the **Automations** tab on your project page.  
   ![automations-tab](./img/automations-tab.png)

2. Click the **New Automation** button.  
   ![new-automation-button](./img/new-automation-button.png)

3. Select **Create Test Automation** in the bottom left.  
   ![create-test-automation](./img/create-test-automation.png)

4. Follow the instructions to configure your test automation.  
   ![configure-test](./img/configure-test.png)

5. Once created, your test automation will appear in the list. Use it to test your function against the projectâ€™s data.

## How to Use Test Automations

Both the [C# SDK](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/main/Automate/Speckle.Automate.Sdk) and [Python SDK](https://github.com/specklesystems/specklepy/tree/main/src/speckle_automate) include utilities for interacting with test automations. Example functions are available in both:

- [C# Example Function](https://github.com/specklesystems/SpeckleAutomateDotnetExample)
- [Python Example Function](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle_automate_python_example)

### Required Environment Variables

To run your tests, configure the following in your environment:

- **Python**: Use a `.env` file ([example](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle_automate_python_example/blob/main/.env.example)).  
- **C#**: Use an `appsettings.json` file ([example](https://github.com/specklesystems/SpeckleAutomateDotnetExample/blob/main/TestAutomateFunction/appsettings.example.json)).

Environment Variables:
- `SPECKLE_TOKEN`: [Create a Personal Access Token](https://speckle.guide/dev/tokens.html).
- `SPECKLE_SERVER_URL`: URL of your Speckle Server, e.g., `https://app.speckle.systems/`.
- `SPECKLE_PROJECT_ID`: The ID of your Speckle project with the test automation.
- `SPECKLE_AUTOMATION_ID`: The ID of your test automation.

The project and automation IDs are in the URL of your automation page: `/projects/[project-id]/automations/[automation-id]`.

## Running Test Cases

1. Set up your local environment with the required values.  
2. Run the test command (`pytest`, `dotnet test`, etc.) from your development setup.  
3. The SDK utilities will:
   - Connect to the test automation via the API.
   - Run your function locally, generating results.
   - Submit the results to the test automation for validation.

Test results will be visible on the automation page and the projectâ€™s automation status display.

## Limitations

To set up a test automation, you must:
- Be an owner of the Speckle project.
- Have published the function to the Function Library.
- Ensure the function has at least one release (current technical limitation).

::: note Future Restrictions  
We may introduce further restrictions, such as requiring the test automation owner to be the author of the function being tested.

## Key Notes on Test Automations

- Test automations do not ask for function inputs during creation; inputs should be set up in your development environment.  
- Test automations are sandboxed environments designed to aid in integration testing. They do not execute functions directly within the Automate runtime.  
- Test runs allow you to debug locally while validating outcomes against Speckle project data.
