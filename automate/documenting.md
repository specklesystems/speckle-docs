# Documenting Your Function

Your function’s `README.md` will be published to its dedicated Automate page. This is your opportunity to communicate the key functionality, limitations, and detailed instructions for the function’s inputs to your team and organisation.

Clear documentation is critical for:

- Helping your team and collaborators understand how to use the function effectively.
- Ensuring consistency and transparency when sharing functions within a Workspace.
- Providing detailed instructions that reduce confusion and the need for additional support.

## Key Points for Documentation

- **Clarity and Precision**: Ensure it is abundantly clear what your function produces given specific source data and input parameters.
- **Detail as Needed**: Provide enough detail about the function’s purpose, logic, and limitations to enable your team to use it effectively.
- **Markdown Support**: Speckle Automate’s function listing supports full Markdown, allowing you to include relevant imagery, links, and formatting for a professional and functional presentation.

### Example

Below is an example of how a well-documented `README.md` might appear on a function listing:
