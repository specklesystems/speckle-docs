## Public Functions: Fully Functional Demonstrations [_COMING SOON_]

Public functions in the Speckle Automate Functions Library are designed to serve as both fully functional solutions and practical demonstrations of how Speckle Automate can be used effectively. They are:

- Ready-to-use in real-world workflows.
- Examples of how to structure functions using Speckle SDKs.
- Starting points for creating custom functions tailored to specific needs.

These functions reflect Speckle Automate's flexibility and power, offering users immediate value and insights into best practices.

## Demo Functions for Use in Automate

Speckle-authored demo functions are continually updated to reflect changes to the SDKs and expand functionality. While not all demo functions are available in the Functions Library, all Speckle-authored functions are published to GitHub alongside our open-source repositories.

These functions are typically namespaced under `speckle-automate-*` to facilitate discovery and reuse.
