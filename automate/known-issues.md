# Known Issues

- The functions library functions are all being updated to the latest version of the SDK. This means that some functions may not work as expected. If you encounter any issues, please report them to the Speckle team.
- Automation run executions and their results performed during the closed beta are not visible in the new web application integration. They are also no longer enabled. New automations will need to be made to see results.
