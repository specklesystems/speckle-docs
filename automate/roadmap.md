# Roadmap

The roadmap for Speckle Automate continues to evolve based on the feedback and insights from beta participants. As we move through the Public Beta phase, our primary focus is on validating the usefulness of Automate against two blockers identified by testers in earlier phases:

1. **Live Data Support**: Automations must run seamlessly against production data on [app.speckle.systems](https://app.speckle.systems), not on a development server.  
2. **Private Function Development**: Organisations need secure, private workflows to realise Automate's potential fully.

### Phase 1: Closed Beta

This phase is now complete. The findings will be shared at an upcoming community standup.

### Phase 2: Open Beta

This phase concluded with the following milestones:
1. Integration of the Automate platform into the Speckle development server ([latest.speckle.systems](https://latest.speckle.systems)).  
2. Introduction of a sandbox environment for local testing of function code against server data.  
3. Initial feedback on user experience and the integration of automation results in the Speckle viewer.

### Phase 3: Public Beta - CURRENT

We are now in the Public Beta phase, focusing on validating Automate as a robust, scalable solution. Key priorities include:

1. **Full Integration**: Automations are now fully integrated into the Speckle web application ([app.speckle.systems](https://app.speckle.systems)), enabling workflows against live production data.  
2. **Private Functions**: Secure private function development is now available within Workspaces, addressing the need for tailored organisational workflows.  
3. **Multi-Model Triggers**: Automations can respond to changes across multiple models, unlocking more dynamic and interconnected workflows.  
4. **Discoverable Public Functions**: A curated library of Speckle-authored public functions is now searchable and available to all users.  

This phase is designed to validate the productâ€™s readiness for broader adoption by addressing the blockers identified in earlier stages.

### Potential Additions During Public Beta

We continue to explore enhancements based on user feedback. Some areas under consideration include:
- Improvements to the user interface for managing multi-model triggers.  
- Expanded options for configuring automation outputs.  
- Additional public functions addressing high-demand workflows.  

While not guaranteed, these additions aim to refine the product further as we approach launch.

### Phase 4: Product Launch

The Public Beta will conclude with the product launch in 2025, which may introduce:

1. Distinct payment and freemium tiers reflecting runtime and compute specifications.  
2. Support publishing functions from multiple code repositories, including GitLab, Azure DevOps, and Bitbucket.  
3. Composable automations with multiple triggers, functions, and outputs for highly customisable workflows.  

Speckle Automate's official release will mark its transition into a mature, scalable platform for the AEC industry.

As we work toward Automate 1.0, your feedback during the Public Beta is more critical than ever. Thank you for helping us shape the future of automation in the AEC industry!
