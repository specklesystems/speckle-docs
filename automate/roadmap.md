# Roadmap

Much of the roadmap for development will be shaped by the feedback we receive from the beta testers. We are looking for feedback on the developer experience, the automation experience, the integration of the automation results in the Speckle viewer, and how you would see Automate as a paid product.

Anything that does not yet exist listed here is entirely speculative and subject to change.

### Phase 1: Closed Beta

This phase is now complete. We will share the findings at a future community standup. 

### Phase 2: Open Beta

This is the current phase. 
1. Integrated the Automate platform into the Speckle development server [latest.speckle.systems](https://latest.speckle.systems).
2. A new sandbox environment for the local testing for function code against server data.
3. We are looking for feedback on the user experience and the integration of the automation results in the Speckle viewer.

### Phase 3: Public Beta
The Public Beta launch is planned for later in 2024. This will include:
1. Full integration into Speckle web application and migrated to [app.speckle.systems](https://app.speckle.systems) with abilty to run automations against production data.
2. The ability to have private functions for your organisation.
3. Multi-model triggers for automations.
4. The public function library will be discoverable and searchable.
   
### Phase 4: Product Launch

Speckle Automate Public Beta will cease as a program on full Automate launch in 2025. 
1. A product with distinct payment and freemium tiers reflecting runtimes and processor specs.
2. Ability to publish code from Gitlab, Azure DevOps, Bitbucket, GitHub and others.
3. Composable automations with multiple triggers, functions and outputs.
