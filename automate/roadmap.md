# Roadmap

The roadmap for Speckle Automate continues to evolve based on the feedback and insights from beta participants. During the Public Beta phase, our primary focus is on validating the usefulness of Automate by addressing two key blockers identified in earlier phases:

1. **Live Data Support**: Automations must run seamlessly against production data on [app.speckle.systems](https://app.speckle.systems), rather than on a development server.  
2. **Private Function Development**: Organisations require secure, private workflows to realise Automate's potential fully.

### Phase 1: Closed Beta

This phase is now complete. The findings will be shared at an upcoming community standup.

### Phase 2: Open Beta

This phase concluded with the following milestones:
1. Integration of the Automate platform into the Speckle development server ([latest.speckle.systems](https://latest.speckle.systems)).  
2. Introduction of a sandbox environment for local testing of function code against server data.  
3. Initial user feedback on the experience and integration of automation results in the Speckle viewer.

## Phase 3: Public Beta - **CURRENT**

We are now in the Public Beta phase, focusing on validating Automate as a robust, scalable solution. Key priorities include:

1. **Full Integration**: Automations are now fully integrated into the Speckle web application ([app.speckle.systems](https://app.speckle.systems)), enabling workflows against live production data.  
2. **Private Functions**: Secure private function development is now available within Workspaces, addressing the need for tailored organisational workflows.  
3. **Multi-Model Triggers**: Automations can respond to changes across multiple models, enabling dynamic, interconnected workflows.  
4. **Discoverable Public Functions** [Coming Soon]: A curated library of Speckle-authored public functions is now searchable and available to all users.  

This phase is critical for validating the productâ€™s readiness for broader adoption and addressing the blockers identified in earlier stages.

### Potential Additions During Public Beta

We are exploring additional enhancements based on user feedback, including:

- Improvements to the user interface for managing multi-model triggers.  
- Advanced results presentation for clearer insights.  
- Expanded options for configuring automation outputs.  
- Additional public functions addressing high-demand workflows.  
- Key additional Speckle functionality delivered by Automate that requires no user interaction.

While these are not guaranteed, they aim to refine the product further as we approach the full launch.

### Phase 4: Product Launch

The Public Beta will conclude with the product launch in 2025, which may introduce:

1. Distinct payment and freemium tiers reflecting runtime and compute specifications.  
2. Support for publishing functions from multiple code repositories, including GitLab, Azure DevOps, and Bitbucket.  
3. Composable automations with multiple triggers, functions, and outputs for highly customisable workflows.  

Speckle Automate's official release will mark its transition into a mature, scalable platform for the AEC industry.

As we work toward Automate 1.0, your feedback during the Public Beta phase is more critical than ever. Thank you for helping us shape the future of automation in the AEC industry!
