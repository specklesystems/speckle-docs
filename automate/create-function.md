# Creating Functions

If you have your verified account on latest.speckle.systems, navigate to [latest.speckle.systems/functions](https://latest.speckle.systems/functions). 

You will now see above the Functions Library. In the top right, there is a new function button:

![new function button](./img/new-function-button.png)

This will launch the function creation wizard

1. **Authorise GitHub:** Required only the first time.
    
    ![authorise github](./img/authorise-github.png)
    
    ::: tip üí° Authorized OAuth Apps
    You will find Speckle Automate in your Github account Authorized OAuth Apps. Access can be revoked at any time, but will be necessary to publish new functions.

2. **Choose a template**: We are launching with Python and C# templates. These reflect our best-supported Speckle SDKs, **speckle-sharp** and **specklepy**. Each of our main SDKs includes the Automate SDK for that language.
3. **Define your function.** (Some of these details can be edited later)
    1. **Choose an avatar/logo/icon** [optional]: This will be displayed in the functions list
    2. **Choose a Name** [required]: This doesn‚Äôt need to be unique, but all functions will be a single list during the beta stages. The search filter will use the function name alone; it could be helpful if it identifies you as an author/company and the name/function intent. *e.g. SolarFarmLayout by Solarcorp*
    3. **Add a description** [required]: This will be the short description used in the function list. The description supports basic Markdown if you wish to add markup.
    4. **Identify source application data supported** [optional]: This may be helpful when defining Automations
    5. **Add Tags** [optional]: A list of terms to categorise your function further. Multi-word tags should use _ or - characters. *e.g. Solar_Panels*
    6. **~~Select a Github Organization** [optional]: This is only relevant if you want to publish as an organization and are a member of one.~~
    7. **Click Next**: All being well, the wizard will create your function project on GitHub.
        
        ::: tip üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Wizard Actions
        You will see that the wizard handles a lot of scaffolding for you. You can navigate to GitHub and see that the template project has been cloned under your repositories:
        
        ![alt text](./img/repo-title.png)
        
        A GitHub action has been created for you; the specification for it is defined in `.github/workflows/**main.yml**`
        
        ![alt text](./img/build-and-deploy.png)
        
        It also has injected two environmental variables as repository secrets for the interaction with the Automate API `SPECKLE_FUNCTION_ID` and `SPECKLE_FUNCTION_TOKEN`:

        ::: tip üí° Note
        Choose whatever Project restrictions you wish, but it must be Public for now.
        :::
        
        </aside>
        
4. Your function has been created! ü•≥ At this point, the template can be edited and amended to suit your own business logic.

5. You can follow the links provided to:
    1. **Open the repo:** this is a link to the project on GitHub
    2. **Open in codespace:** You can get coding immediately in a virtual machine operating in a container at GitHub. Remember that any changes you make must be pushed to your project. 
    3. **Go to function**: This will navigate you to your functions page within Speckle Automate.
6. Your function will only appear in the [functions list](https://automate.speckle.dev/functions) once a first Release has been made.
