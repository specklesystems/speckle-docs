# Providing Feedback

You have been invited to join the Automate closed beta on the understanding that Speckle provides the infrastructure and compute resources and that you provide feedback on:

- The developer experience.
- The automation experience.
- The integration of the automation results in the Speckle viewer.
- How would you see Automate as a paid product?

We, Speckle, will also endeavour to give you the same level of support via the [speckle.community](https://speckle.community/c/making-speckle/insiders-automate/27) forum as we already do for all other Speckle activities. In addition to the invitation to the Speckle Automate platform, you are also invited to join the private channel on the forum dedicated to Automate. 
We look forward to a lively discussion, peer support, ideas sharing, best practices, and reusable code snippets so that you can all progress swiftly toward some success.

We will also send feedback questionnaires to capture specific areas where we want to develop the Automate product to be a first-class experience for function authors, automation composers and project leaders.

## Rewards

If successful function development wasnâ€™t rewarding enough, Speckle may award incentives or rewards for active participation or for finding significant bugs. In turn authors of significantly popular functions may be supported in their contribution to the public function library.

We also encourage Beta participants are free to showcase their successes not only on the community forum but as far and wide as their personal brand can carry.
