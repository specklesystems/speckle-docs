# Providing Feedback

As a participant in the Automate public beta, your feedback is crucial to shaping Speckle Automate as we approach its 1.0 release. We welcome your insights on:

- The **developer experience**: How intuitive and efficient creating, deploying, and managing functions is.  
- The **automation experience**: Usability and effectiveness of setting up and running automations.  
- The **integration of automation results**: How well results are visualised and used within the Speckle viewer.  
- Your thoughts on **cost and value**: How would you see Speckle Automate as a cost to your team, project, or organisation?

### Public and Private Functions in Beta

Currently, Speckle curates and authors all public functions, ensuring they meet the highest standards for functionality and reliability. During the beta, these public functions remain free to run without limits, allowing users to experience the value they bring to their workflows.

Speckle Automate offers private functions for private workflows, which are exclusive to Workspace projects. Compute resources for private functions are monitored but not charged during the beta phase.

While we are not actively testing third-party contributions to the public function library during this beta phase, we are keen to hear from individuals or organisations interested in offering their functions publicly.

## Community Support and Engagement

Speckle remains committed to supporting you throughout the beta. This includes:

- Access to the [Speckle Community Forum](https://speckle.community/c/making-speckle/insiders-automate/27) for discussions, peer support, and idea sharing.  
- Opportunities to collaborate with other beta participants by sharing best practices, reusable code snippets, and creative solutions.

We aim to foster a vibrant exchange of ideas to help you and your team achieve success with Speckle Automate.

## Feedback Mechanisms

To capture your valuable insights, we will periodically send feedback questionnaires. These will help us refine Automate for:

- **Function Authors**: Tools and workflows for creating and maintaining functions.  
- **Automators**: Experiences with designing and managing automations.  
- **Project Leaders**: Integrating automation results into team workflows and decision-making processes.  

Your feedback will shape the final development phase as Automate transitions toward its 1.0 release.

### Showcase Your Success

We encourage you to share your achievements widely:  
- Post updates and success stories on the [Speckle Community Forum](https://speckle.community).  
- Share your work through personal or professional networks to inspire others and highlight your contributions.

Together, we can shape Speckle Automate's future, ensuring it meets the diverse needs of teams, projects, and organisations as we prepare for its official launch.
