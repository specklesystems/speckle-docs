# Speckle Automate Public Beta

::: tip ðŸš§ NOTE  
Speckle Automate has entered the public beta phase and is now available on the Speckle production server: [app.speckle.systems](https://app.speckle.systems). These docs are a work in progress and are updated regularly to reflect the latest features and improvements.  
:::

This documentation is designed to assist Speckle Automate users in creating and managing automation. As a Speckle user, you can now act as an **Automator**, leveraging public functions and creating custom workflows to streamline tasks and enhance productivity.

### Key Highlights:
- **Public Functions**: Available to all users on [app.speckle.systems](https://app.speckle.systems).  
- **Private Functions**: Creatable and manageable within Workspaces.  
- **Unified Hosting**: All data, functions, and automations are hosted on the main Speckle server.  
- **Collaboration**: Workspace members can use public and private functions to create automations collaboratively.

We are continuously improving the documentation. As Speckle Automate evolves, there may be occasions when development temporarily outpaces the documentation. If you have any questions, please contact us on the [Speckle Community Forum: Automate](https://speckle.community/c/making-speckle/insiders-automate/27).
