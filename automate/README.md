# What is Automate?

Speckle Automate is a fully fledged CI/CD platform designed to run custom code on Speckle models whenever a new version is available.

As a software developer, you can [develop Functions](/create-function) that others in your team consume in what we call [Automations](create-automation). From creating reports to running code compliance checks to wind simulations, there is no limit to what you can do with Automate. 

### Coming Soon
Our team will curate a set of **Public Functions** available to all users on [app.speckle.systems](https://app.speckle.systems), which you can use to experience the power of Automate. 


::: tip ðŸš§ NOTE  
Speckle Automate has entered the public beta phase and is now available on the Speckle production server: [app.speckle.systems](https://app.speckle.systems). These docs are a work in progress and are updated regularly to reflect the latest features and improvements.  
:::



We are continuously improving the documentation. As Speckle Automate evolves, there may be occasions when development temporarily outpaces the documentation. If you have any questions, please contact us on the [Speckle Community Forum: Automate](https://speckle.community/c/making-speckle/insiders-automate/27).
