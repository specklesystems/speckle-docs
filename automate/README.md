# Speckle Automate Beta 
::: tip ðŸš§ NOTE
Speckle Automate is in an accessible beta phase and restricted to the Speckle development server. These docs are a work in progress and are updated regularly.

This mini documentation is designed to assist beta testers of Speckle Automate, focusing on the **Function Author** and **Automation Composer** personas. Your feedback is essential in refining these roles within the platform, enhancing functionality, and ensuring a user-friendly experience.

We will continuously improve these documentation details as things develop; there may be occasions when development outpaces the documentation. If you have any questions, please reach out to us on the [Speckle Community Forum: Automate](https://speckle.community/c/making-speckle/insiders-automate/27).
