# Creating Automations

## **What is an Automation?**

- Automations allow you to perform a wide variety of tasks efficiently.  
- Automations apply a function to a Speckle model.  
- Automations enable you to configure a function to meet your specific requirements.

For example, a function might render a photograph-quality image of a model. Automation allows you to specify parameters such as the camera position, lighting, and other settings to customise the output for your particular Speckle model.

## **Creating an Automation**

Automations are created from the **Automations** tab within a project.

::: tip 💡 **Function Availability**
The library view includes both public functions [Coming Soon] and any private functions created for the Workspace if the project is a Workspace project created for your team. This ensures all team-specific and public resources are accessible during automation setup.
