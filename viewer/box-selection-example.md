# Box Selection
Making your own extension is a powerful feature of the viewer. In this example we've made a box selection feature by implementing our own extension. 

You can run the example live [here](https://stackblitz.com/edit/speckle-box-selection?file=index.html) or <VueCustomTooltip label="Embedding works only on chromium based browsers"><ins>embedded</ins></VueCustomTooltip> below


<Stackblitz projectId='speckle-box-selection' :embedOptions="{ 
    height: 500,
    openFile: 'src/main.ts',
    view: 'preview',
    hideExplorer: true,
    hideNavigation: true }" 
/>
