# Advanced Features  

Speckle Workspaces unlock advanced features for enhanced team collaboration, workflow automation, and secure project management. By subscribing to a Workspace, teams gain exclusive access to these capabilities to improve efficiency and ensure data control.

## Private Automate Functions  

Workspaces provide access to **[Speckle Automate](../automate/)**, enabling teams to securely create and manage private automation functions within their Workspace.  

### Key Capabilities:  
- **Private Functions**:  
   - Develop custom automations specific to your team’s workflows.  
   - These functions are only visible within the Workspace, ensuring confidentiality.  

- **Project-Specific Automations**:  
   - Automations created using private functions can be deployed to projects within the Workspace.  
   - These are accessible to **Project Reviewers** and above.  

- **Role-Based Management**:  
   - Only **Admins** and **Project Owners** can create and edit automations.  
   - Contributors and Reviewers can execute automations relevant to their project roles.  

### Example Use Cases:  
- Automating design review processes by generating reports based on project data.  
- Running quality assurance checks to ensure compliance with design standards.  
- Streamlining repetitive tasks like updating model metadata across multiple projects.
