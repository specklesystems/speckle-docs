# Data Residency  

Data residency refers to the concept that data is subject to the laws and regulations of the country in which it is stored. It is an essential consideration for organisations that need to comply with local data protection requirements, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union.

## Why Data Residency?

Data residency helps organisations comply with local data protection laws and regulations.  

For example:  
- The GDPR requires that the personal data of EU citizens be protected according to its standards regardless of where it is stored or processed.  
- In jurisdictions like Australia, specific government-related data must be stored and processed within the country.  

Organisations can meet these legal requirements and demonstrate compliance by ensuring data is stored in a specific location.

## Data Residency in Workspaces  

Speckle workspaces supports data residency by allowing organisations to choose where their data is stored. This feature helps organisations comply with local regulations while maintaining complete data storage and processing control.  

- Each workspace is initially allocated to the default Speckle region.  
- Organisations can choose a different region for their workspace to align with compliance needs.  
- Multiple workspaces can operate in different regions to meet the requirements of various projects or teams.
- Assign multiple data regions to a single workspace with the **Extra data region** add-on for project-level data residency.

## Available data regions

Data residency is a **premium feature** available on the **Business** plan.

- Choose among EU, UK, North America, or Asia Pacific as the default data region for all your workspace projects.
- Buy the **Extra data region** add-on if you need additional, or much more specific, data regions for individual projects in your workspace. <a href="'mailto:billing@speckle.systems">Contact us</a> if you are interested.
- If no region is specified or required, your project data is automatically assigned to one of Speckle's default regions, optimised for server efficiency and minimal latency.
