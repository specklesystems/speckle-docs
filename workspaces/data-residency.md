# Data Residency (Coming Soon)

Data residency is the concept that data is subject to the laws of the country in which it is located. This is an important consideration for organizations that need to comply with data protection regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union.

## Why Data Residency?

Data residency is important because it ensures that organizations can comply with local data protection laws and regulations. For example, while the GDPR requires that personal data of EU citizens is protected to its standards regardless of where it is stored or processed, some jurisdictions, such as Australia, mandate that certain government-related data be stored and processed within the country. By ensuring that data is stored in a specific location, organisations can demonstrate compliance with these regulations.

## Data Residency in Workspaces

Speckle Workspaces support data residency by allowing organizations to choose the location where their data is stored. This ensures that organizations can comply with local data protection laws and regulations, and have full control over where their data is stored and processed.

A Workspace is allocated to the default Speckle region, but organizations have the option to choose a different region. This allows organizations to store their data in a location that complies with local regulations and ensures data residency. An organization may operate multiple Workspaces in different regions to meet the needs of different projects or teams.

## Restricting access

Workspaces is designed to increase the security and privacy of your team's projects while giving greater visibility over who can see and access them. If you have a subset of projects that need to be more secure, you can create a second workspace and invite only the team members who need access to those projects.

## Availability

Data residency is a premium feature available on the Workspace Business plan.
