# Data Sovereignty (Coming Soon)

Data sovereignty is the concept that data is subject to the laws of the country in which it is located. This is an important consideration for organizations that need to comply with data protection regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union.

## Why Data Sovereignty?

Data sovereignty is important because it ensures that organizations can comply with local data protection laws and regulations. For example, the GDPR requires that personal data of EU citizens is stored and processed within the EU. By ensuring that data is stored in a specific location, organizations can demonstrate compliance with these regulations.

## Data Sovereignty in Workspaces

Speckle Workspaces will support data sovereignty by allowing organizations to choose the location where their data is stored. This will ensure that organizations can comply with local data protection laws and regulations, and have full control over where their data is stored and processed.

A Workspace will be allocated to the default Speckle region, but organizations will have the option to choose a different region when creating a Workspace. This will allow organizations to store their data in a location that complies with local regulations and ensures data sovereignty. An organization may operate multiple Workspaces in different regions to meet the needs of different projects or teams.

## Restricting access

Workspaces is designed to increase the security and privacy of your team's projects while giving greater visibility over who can see and access them. If you have a subset of projects that need to be more secure, you can create a second workspace and invite only the team members who need access to those projects.
