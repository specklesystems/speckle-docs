# Workspaces for Companies  

## Verified Domains  

To customise your workspace and make it visible to your entire team, you can verify an email domain associated with your account:  

1. Select your workspace from the sidebar.  
2. Go to the **Settings** tab.  
3. Add a new domain. This will include all email domains youâ€™ve verified for your account.  

## Workspace Protection  

Enabling **Domain Protection** for your workspace ensures that only users with verified email domains can join your workspace.  

- You can still invite external users to specific projects within your workspace.  
- However, these users will not have visibility of other projects in the workspace unless explicitly invited.  

## Workspace Discoverability  

If you mark your workspace as **discoverable**, this will notify team members using the same Speckle server that your workspace exists and that they can request to join.  

- This option provides a low-friction way to allow team members to join your workspace.  
- **Note**: For paid plans, each new member added to your workspace will be billed to your account.
