# Verified Domains

To customise the workspace to be visible to your whole team, you can verify an email domain of your account.

Select your workspace in the sidebar.

Go to the `Settings` tab.

Choose to add a new domain. This will be populated by all email domains that you have verified for your account.

## Workspace Protection

Enabling Domain protection for your workspace will ensure that only users with verified email domains can join your workspace.

You will still be able to invite users to your workspace projects, but they will not have visibility of the other projects in your workspace they are not invited to.

## Workspace Discoverability

If you mare your workspace as discoverable this also alerts team members who are on the Speckle server that your workspace exists and that they can join it.

You may choose this option as a low friction way to allow team members to join your workspace, however, when in a paid plan, each new member will be billed to your account.
