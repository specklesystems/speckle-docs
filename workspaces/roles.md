# Workspace Roles

## Collaborators and reviewers

Workspace admins can invite external users to a workspace as guests. The latter only get access to projects in the workspace to which they are specifically invited. Guests can never own projects in your workspace, but they may become collaborators, which will allow them to write access, or they may be reviewers, which will only grant them read access to the project.

## Roles and permissions

### Workspace admin

- Full ownership of the workspace, including members, projects, and settings
- Project owner for all existing and new workspace projects
- Cannot be removed or have their role changed within a project by non-admins

### Workspace member

- Project viewer for all existing and new workspace projects
- Can be removed or have role changed (for project and workspace) by admins
- Can create and own projects
- Cannot invite to workspace, can only invite other workspace users to projects

### Workspace read/write guest

- Guest on workspace (read-only access), but has collaborator access on at least one project
- By changing an existing user to "guest," they will lose access to existing workspace projects
- Project owners can change their role or remove them

### Workspace read-only guest

- Same as the above, but has only view access on the project
- Giving a read-only guest edit access to at least one project converts them to read/write guests
- Can I use Workspaces as an individual or are they only for teams?

## Workspaces for individuals

You can use Workspaces as an individual, although we encourage you to use them as a team as that's how you can experience maximum value with colleagues on various projects.
