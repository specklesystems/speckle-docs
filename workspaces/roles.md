# Workspace Member Roles

## Contributors and Reviewers

Workspace admins can invite external users to a workspace as **guests**. Guests only have access to projects in the workspace to which they are specifically invited. Guests cannot own projects in your workspace but may be assigned one of the following roles within a project:

- **Contributor**: Grants write access to the project.
- **Reviewer**: Grants read-only access to the project.

## Workspaces for Individuals

You can use Workspaces as an individual, but we encourage using them as part of a team. Workspaces are designed to deliver maximum value when collaborating with colleagues on various projects.
