# About Workspaces  

Speckle Workspaces provide a secure, centralised environment for teams to collaborate, manage projects, and control access to shared data. This documentation outlines how to effectively use Workspaces and leverage their critical features for your organisation.  

## Key Features of Workspaces  

Workspaces are designed to:  
- Enable **granular access control** for projects and team members.  
- Provide **domain-based membership protection** for enhanced security.  
- Support **team collaboration** with centralised project and user management.  
- Streamline project workflows and data sharing.
- Allow for collaboration and team development of automations with [Speckle Automate](../automate/).

Explore the **Starter** or **Business** plans for increased usaged limits and advanced functionality like Single Sign-On (SSO) or custom data residency.  

## Managing Access and Permissions  

Workspaces offer flexible access controls to fit your organisation's needs:  

### Admins  
- Manage workspace members and projects.  
- Add or remove members, assign roles, and enforce security policies.  

### Members  
- View all projects in the workspace by default.  
- Can create, contribute to, and own projects if on an Editor seat
- Cannot invite external users.  

### Guests  
- External collaborators invited to specific projects.  
- Can contribute to projects if on an Editor seat.
- Have limited visibility and access only to the projects to which they are explicitly added.  

## Advanced Security Options  

The Business plan offers features for organisations requiring advanced security and control. Admins can: 
- Restrict membership to specific email domains so only authorised users can join  
- Enable SSO
- Choose a custom region to host the workspace data


## Data Management  

Workspaces make managing project data simple and secure:  
- Projects are centrally managed within the workspace.  
- Members can be assigned a **Can edit** role (write/read access) or **Can view** role (read-only access on web).  
- All data is encrypted and stored in Speckle's secure infrastructure.  

For organisations with regulatory requirements, **[custom data residency](./data-residency.md)** options allow data storage in specific regions.

Workspaces also integrate with **[Speckle Automate](../automate/)**, enabling teams to create private automation functions for advanced project workflows.

## Billing  

Refer to the [Billing Page](./billing.md) for details on subscription plans, pricing, and billing.
