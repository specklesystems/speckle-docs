# Speckle Workspaces Beta

::: tip ðŸš§ NOTE
Speckle Workspaces is in an accessible beta phase but can be used now on production data. It will be a future paid feature. These docs are a work in progress and are updated regularly.
:::

This mini documentation is designed to assist beta testers of Workspaces, and should be useful for the **Workspace Owner** and **Workspace Member** personas. Your feedback is essential in refining these roles within the platform, enhancing functionality, and ensuring a user-friendly experience.

We will continuously improve these documentation details as things develop; there may be occasions when development outpaces the documentation. If you have any questions, please reach out to us on the [Speckle Community Forum: Making Speckle](https://speckle.community/c/making-speckle/).
