# Billing  

Workspaces require a paid subscription to access advanced features, team collaboration tools, and larger-scale operations. This page explains the key billing concepts and operations for managing your Workspace subscription.  

## Trial Period  

All new Workspaces begin with a **31-day trial**. During the trial:  
- You can explore all features available in the **Starter Plan**.  
- No credit card information is required.  
- At the end of the trial, Workspaces enter **read-only mode** if a subscription is not activated.  

For more details on trial behaviour, see [Trial Period Overview](./trial-overview.md).  

## Subscriptions  

To continue using a Workspace beyond the trial period, you will need to subscribe to a paid plan. All billing and subscription options are managed directly in the Workspace **Settings > Billing** section.  

Key points:  
- Subscription costs are calculated based on the number of active members.  
- Plans and pricing details are displayed directly in the in-app billing section.  
- Billing is flexible and supports both monthly and annual payment options.  

## Managing Billing  

You can manage your Workspace subscription directly from the in-app billing interface. Available operations include:  
- **Upgrading or Downgrading Plans**: Switch between available subscription plans as your needs evolve.  
- **Adding or Removing Members**: Costs adjust dynamically based on the number of active members in your Workspace at the end of the billing period.  
- **Cancelling a Subscription**: Cancel your subscription to stop future charges. Workspaces will enter **read-only mode** upon cancellation, but all data remains intact.

## Data and Access  

When a subscription lapses:  
- All Workspace data remains intact and accessible in read-only mode.  
- You cannot create new versions, add members, or make edits until the subscription is reactivated.  

## Notes  

For detailed pricing and feature comparisons, refer to the in-app billing section. To upgrade, manage members, or adjust your Workspace settings, visit **Settings > Billing** in the Workspace interface.
