# Billing  

This page explains the key billing concepts and operations for managing your Workspace subscription.  

## Plans

Workspaces come in three plans:
  
- **Free**: 1 project, 5 models, 7-day comment and version history. No credit card information is required.
- **Starter**: 5 projects, 25 models, 30-day comment and version history
- **Business**: 10 projects, 50 models, full comment and version history, control allowed domains, SSO, custom data residency.  

Add the paid *Unlimited projects and models* add-on to the Starter and Business plans to remove all projet and model usage limits.

## Paid vs. free seats

In a workspace you only pay for users on an Editor seat. Users on a Viewer seat are always free. [Learn more about seat types](./roles.md).

## Subscriptions  

All billing and subscription options are managed directly in the Workspace under **Settings > Billing**.  

Key points:  
- Subscription costs adjust dynamically as you add and remove members.
- When a user on an Editor seat leaves the workspace, their seat remains billed until the next billing cycle begins. The seat can be assigned to another user in the workspace.   
- Plans and pricing details are displayed directly in the in-app billing section.  
- Billing supports both monthly and annual payment options.  

## Managing Billing  

You can manage your Workspace subscription directly from the in-app billing interface. Available operations include:  
- **Upgrading plans**: Easily switch to higher-tier plans as your needs evolve.  
- **Downgrading plans**: Not yet supported in-app; <a href="'mailto:billing@speckle.systems">contact Speckle Support to downgrade</a>.  
- **Inviting people**:
  - Adding new users to a workspace is free because everyone joins on the free Viewer seat. 
  - Assigning someone an Editor seat **immediately increases the subscription cost** by one seat (if no unoccupied Editor seats are available).  
- **Removing people**:  
  - Removing an Editor seat from soneone does not immediately lower the subscription cost.  
  - The Editor seat count will be adjusted at the start of the next billing cycle, unless the Editor seat has been assigned to someone else in the meantime.

- **Cancelling a Subscription**: Cancel your subscription to stop future charges. Workspaces will enter **read-only mode** after the current billing cycle ends, but all data remains intact.  

## Data and Access  

When a subscription lapses:  
- All Workspace data remains intact and accessible in read-only mode.  
- You can only create new versions, add members, or edit once the subscription is reactivated.  

## Notes  

- The in-app billing section provides detailed pricing and feature comparisons.  
- To upgrade, manage members, or adjust your Workspace settings, visit **Settings > Billing** in the Workspace interface.
