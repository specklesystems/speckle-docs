# Billing

## Workspaces are free while in beta

While Speckle is offering Workspaces for free during the beta phase, it will be a paid feature in the future. This section will detail the billing and subscription information for Workspaces.

While in beta, the billing system will give a cost estimate based on the number of members in the workspace. This will be updated to a monthly subscription model in the future.

Once the beta period ends, workspaces are still free up to 500 model versions.
To store more versions across your projects you will need to upgrade to a paid plan.
