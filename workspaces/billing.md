# Billing  

Workspaces require a paid subscription to access advanced features, team collaboration tools, and larger-scale operations. This page explains the key billing concepts and operations for managing your Workspace subscription.  

## Trial Period  

All new Workspaces begin with a **31-day trial** of the **Starter Plan**. During the trial:  
- You can explore all features available in the Starter Plan.  
- No credit card information is required.  
- At the end of the trial, Workspaces enter **read-only mode** if a subscription is not activated.  

## Subscriptions  

To continue using a Workspace beyond the trial period, you will need to subscribe to a paid plan. All billing and subscription options are managed directly in the Workspace **Settings > Billing** section.  

Key points:  
- Subscription costs are calculated based on the **current member count** at the end of the billing cycle.  
- When members are removed, their seat remains allocated and billed until the next billing cycle begins.  
- Plans and pricing details are displayed directly in the in-app billing section.  
- Billing supports both monthly and annual payment options.  

## Managing Billing  

You can manage your Workspace subscription directly from the in-app billing interface. Available operations include:  
- **Upgrading Plans**: Easily switch to higher-tier plans as your needs evolve.  
- **Downgrading Plans**: Not yet supported in-app; contact Speckle Support to downgrade.  
- **Adding or Removing Members**: Costs adjust dynamically based on the **current member count** at the end of the billing period.  
- **Cancelling a Subscription**: Cancel your subscription to stop future charges. Workspaces will enter **read-only mode** after the current billing cycle ends, but all data remains intact.  

## Data and Access  

When a subscription lapses:  
- All Workspace data remains intact and accessible in read-only mode.  
- You cannot create new versions, add members, or make edits until the subscription is reactivated.  

## Notes  

- The in-app billing section provides detailed pricing and feature comparisons.  
- To upgrade, manage members, or adjust your Workspace settings, visit **Settings > Billing** in the Workspace interface.
