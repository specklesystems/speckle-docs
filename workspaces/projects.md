# Workspace Projects  

Workspace projects are centralised repositories for collaborative workflows, enhanced with features like advanced security, role-based access, and automation integration.

## Key Features of Workspace Projects  

- Centralised project management with **granular access controls**.  
- Integration with **Speckle Automate** for tailored workflow enhancements.  
- Advanced options for project migration and data residency.  

## Managing Project Access  

Workspaces are designed for secure and controlled collaboration. To manage project access:  

- Use role-based permissions to define **Can edit** (read/write access) and **Can view** (read-only web access) project roles.  
- Leverage workspace-level domain policies to enforce compliance with your organisation's email domains.  
- For stricter access, create a separate Workspace for sensitive projects and invite only necessary team members.  

## Migrating Projects  

Moving a project from a personal account to a workspace enables team collaboration and advanced features.

### How Migration Works:  
- You can move a project to a workspace if you are the **Project owner** of the project and an **Admin** in the target workspace.
- The project can be moved to the workspace if it doesn't go above the project and model limits of the workspace plan. 
- The project will be moved to the workspaces's dedicated data region upon moving if this has been set up.

## Automate Integration in Projects  

Workspace projects support Speckle Automate, enabling advanced automation workflows:  

1. **Private Functions**:  
   - Workspace members and admins can create private automation functions to streamline workflows and enforce standards.  
   - These functions are visible to all Workspace members.  

2. **Automations in Projects**:  
   - Automations (created using private functions) are tied to specific projects and are visible to all project members.  
   - Only **Admins** and **Project Owners** can create or edit automations.  

3. **Role-Based Permissions**:  
   - **Admins and Project Owners**: Full control over automations, including creation and editing.  
   - Project members with **Can edit** permissions: Can execute automations assigned to their projects.
