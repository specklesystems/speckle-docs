# Workspace Projects

Creating a new project in a workspace is the same process as for personal projects, but with a few additional features.

## Create a project

To create a project in a workspace, click the `New Project` button. You can then name the project and select access permissions per normal. By default, your workspace members and admins will be added to the project with View permissions.

## Viewing projects

In the workspace settings screen, you can see all the projects in the workspace.

In the project pages and model views the Workspace name will be shown as a navigation link as part of the page title. In non-workspace projects, the workspace name will not be shown and instead a link to all Projects list.

## Restricting access

Workspaces is designed to increase the security and privacy of your team's projects while giving greater visibility over who can see and access them. If you have a subset of projects that need to be more secure, you can create a second workspace and invite only the team members who need access to those projects.

## *Migrating projects (Coming soon)*

*You can migrate a project from a personal account to a workspace by selecting Move Project in the Workspace dashboard. This will move the project to the workspace and remove it from your personal account.*

*When you move a personal project to a workspace with domain locking in place, all contributors not compliant with the workspace domain policy will be migrated but highlighted as non-compliant in the Members window.*
