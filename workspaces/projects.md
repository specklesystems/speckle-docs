# Workspace Projects

Creating a new project in a workspace follows the same process as personal projects but with additional features designed for team collaboration and enhanced security.

## Create a Project

To create a project in a workspace:  

1. Click the `New Project` button.  
2. Name the project and set access permissions as usual.  

All workspace members and admins will be added to the project with **View** permissions by default.

## Viewing Projects

In the workspace **Settings** screen, you can view all the projects associated with the workspace.  

On project pages and model views, the **Workspace name** will appear as a navigation link in the page title. For non-workspace projects, the workspace name will not be shown. Instead, a link to the **All Projects** list will be displayed.

## Restricting Access

Workspaces are designed to enhance the security and privacy of your teamâ€™s projects while providing greater visibility and control over access permissions.  

If you have projects requiring stricter access control, you can:  

- Create a separate workspace for those projects.  
- Invite only the necessary team members to ensure access remains limited.  

## Migrating Projects

You can migrate a project from a personal account to a workspace by selecting **Move Project** in the Workspace dashboard. This action will:  

- Transfer the project to the workspace and remove it from your account.  
- Preserve the data region of the original project.  

### *Data Region Migration (Coming Soon)*

*While migrated projects will currently remain in the data region where they were initially authored, the ability to migrate projects to a data region of your choice is coming soon.*
