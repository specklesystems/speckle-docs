# Workspace Projects  

Workspace projects are centralised repositories for collaborative workflows, enhanced with features like advanced security, role-based access, and automation integration.

## Key Features of Workspace Projects  

- Centralised project management with **granular access controls**.  
- Integration with **Speckle Automate** for tailored workflow enhancements.  
- Advanced options for project migration and data residency.  

## Automate Integration in Projects  

Workspace projects support Speckle Automate, enabling advanced automation workflows:  

1. **Private Functions**:  
   - Workspace members and admins can create private automation functions to streamline workflows and enforce standards.  
   - These functions are visible to all Workspace members.  

2. **Automations in Projects**:  
   - Automations (created using private functions) are tied to specific projects and visible to **Project Reviewers** and above.  
   - Only **Project Owners** and above can create or edit automations.  

3. **Role-Based Permissions**:  
   - **Admins and Project Owners**: Full control over automations, including creation and editing.  
   - **Contributors and Reviewers**: Can execute automations assigned to their projects.  

## Managing Project Access  

Workspaces are designed for secure and controlled collaboration. To manage project access:  

- Use role-based permissions to define **Contributors** (write access) and **Reviewers** (read-only access).  
- Leverage workspace-level domain policies to enforce compliance with your organisation's email domains.  
- For stricter access, create a separate Workspace for sensitive projects and invite only necessary team members.  

## Migrating Projects  

Moving a project from a personal account to a Workspace enables team collaboration and advanced features.  

### How Migration Works:  
- The project has been transferred to Workspace and removed from your account.  
- The data region of the original project is preserved.  

### Upcoming Feature: Data Region Migration  
*In the future, you can move migrated projects to a different data region to comply with regulatory or organisational requirements.*  

## Advanced Usage Tips  

- **Automation Across Projects**: Use shared functions to standardise team workflows in multiple projects.  
- **Access Reviews**: Regularly audit project access and automations for security and compliance.  
- **Optimising for Large Teams**: Segment projects across multiple Workspaces for more explicit boundaries and easier management.
