# Managing Members

All workspace members can be managed from the **People** page in the workspace settings. This screen displays everyone added to the workspace, [their role and seat type](./roles.md), and the date they were added. You can also see users who have been invited but have not yet accepted the invitation to join the workspace.

## Adding Members

To add a member to a workspace:  

1. Click the **Invite** button in the top-right corner of the **People** screen.  
2. Select if you want the person to join as a `Member` or a `Guest`
2. Enter the email address of the team member you want to invite.   

Inviting is always free. People join your workspace on a free Viewer seat, and you can give them an Editor seat later if they need to contribute to projects beyond viewing and commenting.

### Role-Specific Notes:
- Only **Admins** can invite new people to the workspace and enforce access security policies.  

If the invited user is not already a Speckle user, they will receive an email invitation to join Speckle and the workspace.

## Removing Members

To remove a person from a workspace:  

1. Click the `...` button next to their name in the **Members** screen.  
2. Select **Remove user**.  
3. Confirm the removal in the dialogue box.  

Once removed:  
- The user will no longer have access to the workspace or any of its projects.  
- This includes projects they had been directly invited to.  
- Any private automation functions authored by the removed user will remain accessible within the Workspace.

## Managing Seats

Members and Guests can be assigned either an **Editor seat** or a **Viewer seat**.

For **Members**:
- Editor seat: Gives a Member permission to create new projects and take on any role in a project.
- Viewer seat: Gives a Member general access to all projects in the workspace with the **Can view** project role.

For **Guests**:
- Editor seat: Gives a Guest permission to hold the **Can edit** role in the projects they are invited to.
- Viewer seat: Gives a Guest permission to hold the **Can view** role in the projects they are invited to.

The Viewer seat is always free while the Editor seat is a paid seat on the Starter and Business plans.

## Managing Automation Access

Speckle Automate is integrated with Workspaces, allowing members and admins to author and manage private automation functions. Ensure that members with access to automation functions have appropriate roles and permissions.
