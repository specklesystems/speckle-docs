# Managing Members

All members of a workspace can be managed from the workspace settings Members screen. You will see all members added to the workspace, [their role](./roles.md), and the date they were added. You can also see those invited users not yet having accepted joining the workspace.

## Member Status

You will see two types of status indication for each workspace member and guest:

Verified and Unverified. A verified user is one who has verified that the email they signed up with is truly theirs. All users who have signed up with an email address are unverified until they verify their email address.

The second possible status will be for members whose email address is not compliant with the workspace domain policy. These users will be marked as Non-Compliant. Project guests who are non-compliant with the workspace rules will be so highlighted in the Members window. This can happen when a project is moved from a personal account to a workspace with domain locking in place, or the domain policy is changed after the project is created or added.

## Adding Members

To add a member to a workspace, click the `Invite` button in the top right of the Members screen. You can then invite team members by email address. As the address completes, any existing Speckle users will be suggested.

You can set the role of the user as either `Guest`, `Member`, or `Admin`. Any user not already a Speckle user will receive an email inviting them to join Speckle and the workspace.

## Removing Members

To remove a member from a workspace, click the `Remove user` button from the '...' button next to their name in the Members screen. You will be asked to confirm the removal, and the user will be removed from the workspace immediately. They will no longer have access to any projects in the workspace including thoe they had been invited to directly.
