# Managing Members

All workspace members can be managed from the **Members** screen in the workspace settings. This screen displays all members added to the workspace, [their role](./roles.md), and the date they were added. You can also see users who have been invited but have not yet accepted the invitation to join the workspace.

## Member Status

Workspace members and guests can have two types of status indicators:  

1. **Verified** and **Unverified**:  
   - A **verified** user has confirmed ownership of the email address they signed up with.  
   - A user remains **unverified** until they verify their email address.  

2. **Compliant** and **Non-Compliant**:  
   - Members whose email addresses do not comply with the workspace domain policy will be marked as **Non-Compliant**.  
   - Non-compliant status can occur when:  
     - A project is moved from a personal account to a workspace with domain locking enabled.  
     - The domain policy is changed after a project is created or added.  
   - Non-compliant members and guests will be highlighted in the **Members** window.  

## Adding Members

To add a member to a workspace:  

1. Click the **Invite** button in the top-right corner of the **Members** screen.  
2. Enter the email address of the team member you want to invite.  
   - If the user is an existing Speckle user, their name will be suggested as you type.  

You can assign the user a role:  
- `Guest`  
- `Member`  
- `Admin`  

If the invited user is not already a Speckle user, they will receive an email invitation to join Speckle and the workspace.

## Removing Members

To remove a member from a workspace:  

1. Click the `...` button next to their name in the **Members** screen.  
2. Select **Remove user**.  
3. Confirm the removal in the dialogue box.  

Once removed:  
- The user will no longer have access to the workspace or any of its projects.  
- This includes projects they had been directly invited to.
