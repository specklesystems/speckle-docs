# Getting Started

## Create a workspace

You can create a workspace from the Introducing Workspaces page or from the sidebar with the `+` button.

The Workspace name doesn't need to be unique, but it should be descriptive enough to help you and your team identify it. You can also add a description and a logo to the workspace.

## Invite team members

To invite team members, you can use the `Invite` button in the top right and that will allow you to invite team members by email address. As the address completes any existing Speckle users will be suggested.

You can at this time set the role of the user as either `Guest`, `Member` or `Admin`.

Any user not already a Speckle user will receive an email inviting them to join Speckle and the workspace.

## Create a workspace project

To create a project in a workspace, click the `New Project` button . You can then name the project and select the stream to use. By default, your workspace members and admins will be added to the project with appropriate permissions.
