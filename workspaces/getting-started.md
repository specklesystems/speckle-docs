# Getting Started

## Create a workspace

Go to the top left navigation in the Speckle web app and click the `+` in the workspaces section


The workspace name doesn't need to be unique, but it should be descriptive enough to help you and your team identify it. You can also add a description and a logo to the workspace.

## Invite team members

To invite team members, you can use the `Invite your team` button in the right sidebar of your workspace. This will allow you to invite team members by email address.

You can invite new people as either a `Member` or `Guest`. Inviting is always a free action as all new people join a workspace on the free Viewer seat.

Any user not already a Speckle user will receive an email inviting them to join Speckle and the workspace.

## Create a workspace project

To create a project in a workspace, click the `New project` button. You can then name the project and select the stream to use. By default, your workspace members and admins will be able to view the project.
