# Single Sign-On [SSO]

SSO is a user authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications with one set of login credentials. If your organisation already uses SSO for other applications, Speckle now supports it as well.

## Why SSO?

SSO is a more secure way to manage user access across multiple applications. It enables centralised management of user access and simplifies the process of adding and removing users from your organisation.

## SSO for Workspaces

SSO is available for **Workspaces Plus** and **Workspaces Business** plans, ensuring that only users with the correct credentials can access your organisationâ€™s Speckle data.
