# Single Sign-On [SSO] (Coming Soon)

SSO is a user authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications with one set of login credentials. It is likely that your organization already uses SSO for other applications, and we are working to support this for Speckle as well.

## Why SSO?

SSO is a more secure way to manage user access to multiple applications. It allows you to manage user access centrally, and it simplifies the process of adding and removing users from your organization.

## SSO for Workspaces

SSO will be available for Workspaces, allowing you to ensure that only users with the correct credentials can access your organization's Speckle data.
