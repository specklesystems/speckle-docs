# Frequently Asked Questions

## Workspace Access and Permissions

- **What is the difference between Read and Write permissions?**  
  Read permissions allow you to view projects but not make changes. Write permissions let you contribute to projects. This distinction applies to guests in the workspace.

- **Can external collaborators access my Workspace?**  
  Yes, but only if you invite them.

- **What happens if someone leaves my team?**  
  If a team member leaves or is removed, they lose access to all projects in the workspace immediately.

- **Can I have multiple Workspaces under one account?**  
  Yes, there is no limit to the number of Workspaces you can have.

## Workspace Features and Customisation

- **Can I use Workspaces individually, or are they only for teams?**  
  You can use Workspaces as an individual to organise your work. However, Workspaces are designed to shine in a team environment with tools for collaboration and project management.

- **Can I customise the Workspace interface to suit my team’s project workflow?**  
  Customisation is limited to the Workspace name, description, and logo.

- **Can I switch between different Workspace plans?**  
  Plan switching is not yet available but is under development and will be detailed soon.

## Data and Security

- **How does Speckle ensure data security within Workspaces?**  
  Projects in paid Workspaces are private by default, and all data is stored encrypted. Workspace admins manage membership, while project owners control their teams but cannot add non-members. Admins can also enforce a domain-based email policy for additional security.

- **What happens to my data when I create a Workspace?**  
  Existing data remains unaffected. Any new projects created in the Workspace will benefit from its protections and policies.

- **Will my data be backed up automatically in a Workspace?**  
  Yes, backups are handled automatically as per our data policies.

- **What are the storage limits for Workspaces?**  
  There are no limits on version storage. File upload limits will increase to 100 TB.

- **Where is my data stored if I’m not using Workspaces?**  
  For projects outside of Workspaces, data is stored in Speckle's default regions. These are dynamically assigned based on server efficiency and latency to ensure optimal performance for the user creating the project. Specific data residency is not guaranteed outside of Workspaces.

## Subscription and Billing

- **What is the mechanism if I have 2 members at the start of the month and 5 at the end?**  
  You will be billed for the total number of members at the end of the month, which in this case would be 5.

- **What happens to my Workspace if I decide to cancel my subscription?**  
  If your version limit is exceeded, further edits will be blocked, but your data will remain intact until you reactivate your subscription.

## Features and Support

- **Can I migrate my existing Speckle projects to a Workspace?**  
  Yes, this feature is now live. Migrated projects will remain in the data region in which they were authored. The ability to migrate projects to a different data region is coming soon.

- **How do I request a custom plan for my Workspace?**  
  Contact us at <office@speckle.systems>, and we can tailor an offer depending on your needs.

- **What support options are available for Workspace users?**  
  Please refer to our support offerings or contact us directly for assistance.

## Speckle for Free and Paid Features

- **Is Speckle's free version going away?**  
  No, Speckle's free version is here to stay. Projects created outside of Workspaces are referred to as Personal Projects.

- **If I can have unlimited projects and versions for free, why would I pay?**  
  Paid Workspaces offer advanced features like permission management, data security policies, domain-based restrictions, and regional controls. If you don’t need these features, the free version will continue to meet your needs.

## Enterprise and Self-hosting

- **Is Workspaces available on enterprise servers?**  
  Not currently. We’re first refining the enterprise use experience within Workspaces on our server. However, we welcome discussions with all Enterprise partners about their needs and how this offering may evolve to support them.
  
- **Is Workspaces available to self-hosters?**  
  A self-hosted server already provides full control over security and project team access. While making Workspaces available for self-hosting is not a priority, we may explore this option. A licence from Speckle would be required.

- **Is Workspaces open-source?**  
  No, Workspaces is licensed under a source-available licence.
