# Frequently Asked Questions

## Workspace Access and Permissions

- **What is the difference between Read and Write permissions?**  
Read permissions allow you to view projects but not make changes. Write permissions let you contribute to projects. This distinction applies to guests in the workspace.

- **Can external collaborators access my Workspace?**  
Yes, but only if you invite them.

- **What happens if someone leaves my team?**  
If a team member leaves or is removed, they lose access to all projects in the workspace immediately.

- **Can I have multiple Workspaces under one account?**  
Yes, there is no limit on the number of Workspaces you can have.

## Workspace Features and Customisation

- **Can I use Workspaces as an individual or are they only for teams?**  
You can use Workspaces as an individual to organise your work. However, Workspaces are designed to shine in a team environment with tools for collaboration and project management.

- **Can I customise the Workspace interface to suit my team’s workflow for projects in it?**  
Customisation is limited to the Workspace name, description, and logo.

- **Can I switch between different Workspace plans?**  
Switching plans is still under development and will be detailed soon.

## Data and Security

- **How does Speckle ensure data security within Workspaces?**  
Projects in paid Workspaces are private by default, and all data is stored encrypted. Workspace admins manage membership, while project owners control their teams but can’t add non-members. Admins can also enforce a domain-based email policy for additional security.

- **What happens to my data when I create a Workspace?**  
Existing data remains unaffected. Any new projects created in the Workspace will benefit from its protections and policies.

- **Will my data be backed up automatically in a Workspace?**  
Yes, backups are handled automatically as per our data policies.

- **What are the storage limits for Workspaces?**  
There are no limits on version storage, and the file upload limit will increase to 100 TB.

## Subscription and Billing

- **What is the mechanism if I have 2 members at the start of the month and 5 at the end?**  
You will be billed for the total number of members at the end of the month, which in this case would be 5.

- **What happens to my Workspace if I decide to cancel my subscription?**  
If your version limit is exceeded, further edits will be blocked, but your data will remain intact until you reactivate your subscription.

## Upcoming Features and Support

## Speckle for Free and Future Plans

No, Speckle’s free version is here to stay.

- **If I can have unlimited projects and versions for free, why would I pay?**
