# Installing Connectors

Speckle Connectors can be installed from Speckle Manager, a standalone desktop application, or individually.
While Manager isn't strictly required to use the Speckle platform, we highly recommend using it to help keep track of your connectors, install the latest updates and handle multiple user accounts.

::: tip IMPORTANT üôå
This guide assumes you have a **Speckle Account**.
If you don't, register on our [free XYZ Speckle server](https://speckle.xyz).
