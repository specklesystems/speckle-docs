# Welcome!

<div class="banner-ribbon">
  <span><b>Notice</b>: This user guide is based on V2 connectors.</span>
  <span class="next-gen">Next Gen connectors are coming soon, bringing significant changes to the documentation and features!</span>
</div>

Thanks for visiting our user guide! This is the single source of documentation on everything Speckle.

Organizations worldwide rely on our collaboration, interoperability, and automation platform to deliver better buildings faster. Speckle is a platform with endless possibilities. We'll walk you through some of its most common usage scenarios, but ultimately, you'll have the flexibility to use Speckle (and your data) however you want.

## What We'll Cover

This guide introduces the key Speckle concepts you'll need to know. We'll go over what you need to install, how to [create an account](/user/quickstart.html#registration), and how to [send data](/user/ui.html#sending-data) to your first Speckle project.

We also have a few [tutorials](https://speckle.systems/tutorials/) that provide step-by-step guidance for several common workflows (e.g. sending data Rhino ‚Üí Revit and back).

If you're a programmer wanting to learn how to build things with Speckle, head to our [developer docs](/dev/). After some in-depth reading on how Speckle works under the hood, check the [core concepts section](/dev/base).

::: tip IMPORTANT üôå
This guide assumes you have access to a **Speckle Server**.  
If your company doesn't provide one, you can use our [free Speckle server](https://app.speckle.systems/).

## Our Tech

Speckle is made up of several moving parts. Before describing each in detail, here's a quick overview:

### Speckle Web App

[![Web App Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/QI5pVV1GCNs/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QI5pVV1GCNs)

The [Speckle Web App](https://app.speckle.systems/) lets you manage and coordinate your data directly from your browser. It includes a 3D model viewer and project management tools for accessing and collaborating on your data.



### Connectors

Our desktop [connectors](/user/connectors) are plugins for some of the most widely used design tools in the AEC industry ‚Äî including Rhino, Revit, Grasshopper, Dynamo, AutoCAD, SketchUp, Civil3D, Unity, Blender, and more.

Connectors allow you to send and receive data between your authoring tool and your Speckle server. Data is transformed from native formats to Speckle‚Äôs neutral, structured format, making it easy to access, version, and share across tools.

üëâ Most connectors now support **direct sign-in** and can be downloaded individually from our  
üîó **[Connectors Portal](https://app.speckle.systems/connectors)**



### Speckle Manager (Legacy)

![Speckle-Manager](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51519350/185951596-c3b4b52b-c1df-4199-94fd-61246f6227c2.gif)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Speckle Manager is now considered **legacy** for most workflows.

Previously, Speckle Manager was required to install connectors and manage accounts.  
**Today, most connectors are standalone** and handle authentication internally ‚Äî no Manager required.

If you're using legacy tools or setups, you can still learn more on the [Speckle Manager page](/user/manager).
