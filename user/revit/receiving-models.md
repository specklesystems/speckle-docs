# Receiving from Speckle into Revit

In this section, you will learn how to receive models sent to Speckle into Revit.

:::tip NOTE✍️
We have renamed the core concepts in Speckle to be more widely understandable.

- *Streams* have been renamed to **projects**
- *Branches* have been renamed to **models**
- *Commits* have been renamed to **versions**

## Receiving a Speckle Model

To receive a Speckle model:

1. Select a Speckle **Project.**
2. Switch to **Receive** tab.
3. Select a Speckle **Model** to receive from
4. Click **Receive**.

That’s it! You will have the latest version of the selected model received.

## Receiving a Specific Version

If you want to receive a specific version of the selected model:

1. **Expand** Receive Options by clicking on the **Edit**
2. Click on the **Version** Dropdown.
3. **Select the version**.
4. Click **Receive**.

## Receive Modes

When receiving a model that has been received before, you might want to **Update**, **Create** or **Ignore** elements that were already created before. This is when the **Receive Mode** setting comes in! This is how it works:

1. **Update**: updates elements if they already exist and creates missing ones (current behavior in Revit)
2. **Create**: always creates new elements even if pre-existing (current behavior in Rhino)
3. **Ignore**: skips elements if they already exist
