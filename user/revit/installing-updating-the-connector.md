## Installation Options

There are two ways to install the Revit Connector:

- **Recommended**: Use [Speckle Manager](https://speckle.systems/download/) to easily install and manage connectors.
- **Manual**: Download the installer directly from the [Speckle Releases page](https://releases.speckle.systems) if Manager isn't an option for you.

::: warning
Before beginning installation, please make sure Revit is closed.
