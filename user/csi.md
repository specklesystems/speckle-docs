The following documentation refers to the **legacy V2 connectors** for CSI products.

These are no longer actively developed and will not receive further updates. If you still rely on them, please consider migrating to the Next Gen versions as they become available.



## Getting Started (Legacy)

The V2 CSI connectors were installed via Speckle Manager. Once installed, you could find them under the **Tools > PlugIn** tab in the CSI software.
