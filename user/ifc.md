# IFC Import Service

Speckle can now process IFC files and store them in your streams. You can then receive them in other applications and access them from the Speckle API.

> This was made possible thanks to the amazing IFC.js Open Source project! üôåüèº

Our **Import IFC** service can be found in the Stream page sidebar, right under the `Globals` section:

![IFC Import](./img-ifc/ifc-sidebar.png)

Once selected, you'll see the IFC Import panel with 2 main sections:

![IFC Panel Sections](./img-ifc/ifc-panels.png)

## Upload new files

To upload new files, just drag and drop the `.ifc` file from your computer into the panel. A new item will appear bellow the "drag-and-drop" zone indicating the file was successfully added.

For each file, you can specify what branch of the stream to upload and save to (by default it will be sent to `main`) by selecting the branch name from the drop-down menu.

Once ready, press `Upload` to start the process. The item will then be moved to the `Previous Uploads`.

## Previous Uploads

Here you'll be able to view the list of previously uploaded ifc files in that specific stream.

It will also report the current status of the import operation:

1. `Converting`: the operation is still on-going, or is queued to start.

2. `Error`: the import operation failed. You can hover the error for more details on what went wrong.

3. `View Commit`: the import operation succeeded, and there's a new commit on the selected branch. Click on the button to view it.

You can also download the original `.ifc` file that was used to create this commit at any point in the future by pressing the `download` icon on the left-hand side of the file name.

## Final result

The result will be available directly in the 3D viewer, and can be received in other applications. Here's a quick example:
