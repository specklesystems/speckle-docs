These Connectors take care of sending and receiving data to your Speckle server, in the form of streams (no need for files or file types!)

## Installation

All our connectors (with a few exceptions) are distributed via the [Speckle Manager](/user/manager). See our section on [installing connectors](/user/manager.html#installing-connectors) for more details.

## Units

The connectors take care of unit conversions for geometric objects so you don't have to worry about that. For example, if you're sending a 1 foot long line from Rhino to an AutoCAD document in mm it will measure exactly 304.8mm.

Unit conversion also automatically happens on BIM metadata, so if you're sending a Wall [using the Schema Builder](/user/grasshopper.html#schema-builder) node from Grasshopper to Revit the connectors will take care of converting the height for you.

::: tip IMPORTANT ðŸ™Œ
Custom metadata and non-linear units are not currently being converted.
