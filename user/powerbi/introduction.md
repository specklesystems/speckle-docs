# Power BI

Speckle's connection to Power BI consists of two parts.

- Power BI Data Connector

These two parts complement each other. Together, they create a synergy that empowers you to unlock your data, making your reports truly immersive and engaging.

# Power BI Data Connector

You can access and analyze data from those applications without hassle by connecting Power BI with Speckle's extensive connections with AEC applications (like Revit, Archicad, Navisworks, Grasshopper, etc.).

::: warning ⚠️ WARNING
