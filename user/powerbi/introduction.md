# Power BI

Speckle's connection to Power BI consists of two parts.

- Power BI Data Connector
- 3D Viewer Visual

These two parts complement each other. Together, they create a synergy that empowers you to unlock your data, making your reports truly immersive and engaging.

# Power BI Data Connector

## Introduction

Speckle Connector for Power BI lets you easily get data from Speckle into your Power BI reports and visualizations. You can access and analyze data from those applications without hassle by connecting Power BI with Speckle's extensive connections with AEC applications (like Revit, Archicad, Navisworks, Grasshopper, etc.).

::: warning ⚠️ WARNING
Currently, Speckle Connector for Power BI supports **Power BI Desktop only**.
