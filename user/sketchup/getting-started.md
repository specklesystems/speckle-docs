# SketchUp

SketchUp connector currently supports SketchUp 2020, 2021, 2022 and 🆕2023.

:::tip
SketchUp Connector is currently in beta and only available on **Windows**! If you'd like to try installing on a different platform or for a different version, you can do a [manual installation](/user/sketchup/manual-installation).
:::

As this connector is still in heavy development, see the **[repo](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sketchup)** for the latest updates.
