# Basic Usage

In this page, we’ll show some basic operations you can do using SketchUp connector.

## Sending Data

For the moment, there is only one send mode: **Selection**.

To send data:

1. Select all the objects you want to send.
2. Click on the "**Send**" cube.
3. If you wish to change the target model, click on the selected model and choose the desired model from the dropdown menu.

## Receiving Data

Receiving models in SketchUp is as simple as clicking the "**Receive**" cube. As with sending, you can switch the targeted model and the particular version to receive.

::: warning
Note that if you sent SketchUp groups to a model, they will be received as component instances rather than groups.

Creating a new project is also really easy.

1. Click on the "**Create New Project**" button.
2. A dialog box will appear. Provide a **name** for your project and an optional **description**.
3. To make your project **private**, use the toggle option.
4. Click on the "**Create**" button to finalize and create your project.

That's it! Your new project is now successfully created.

## Creating a Model

2. A new dialog box will open where you can **name** your model and optionally provide a **description** for it.

If you have the URL of the project you want to receive, you can easily add it using the "**Add By ID or URL**" button. Paste the URL of the data you want to receive and click “**Add**”. A Project Card will be added, with the model and version selected from the pasted URL.
