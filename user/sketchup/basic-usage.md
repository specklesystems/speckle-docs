# Basic Usage

<div class="banner-ribbon">
  <span><b>Notice</b>: This user guide is based on the V2 SketchUp connector.</span>
  <span class="next-gen">SketchUp is now supported in the Next Gen connector ecosystem. These docs refer to the legacy version only.</span>
</div>

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This documentation covers the legacy (V2) SketchUp connector, which is no longer actively developed.  
> üëâ We recommend trying the new Next Gen connector available at [**app.speckle.systems/downloads**](https://app.speckle.systems/downloads)


In this page, we‚Äôll show some basic operations using the legacy V2 SketchUp connector.

This V2 connector relied on accounts added through [**Speckle Manager**](https://speckle.guide/user/manager).  

Account switching was done by clicking your profile image and selecting from the available list.

> In the Next Gen version, sign-in is fully integrated into the connector itself ‚Äî no Manager required.
