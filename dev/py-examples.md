# Examples

This doc will show you the basics of sending and receiving data and give you an overview of SpecklePy functionality. However, it is not comprehensive. For more examples, please explore the repo's [tests](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-py/tree/main/tests).

## Sending & Receiving

Let's look at how to send an object to a stream on your server and then receive that object back.

First, you'll need to create and authenticate a client. To use the client, you'll need access to a Speckle server. To authenticate the client, you'll either need local accounts (added using [Manager](/user/manager)), or you can go to `your-server.com/profile` and create a Personal Access Token.

```py
from specklepy.api.client import SpeckleClient
from specklepy.api.credentials import get_default_account

# initialise the client
client = SpeckleClient(host="your-server.com") # or whatever your host is
# client = SpeckleClient(host="localhost:3000", use_ssl=False) or use local server

# authenticate the client with a token
account = get_default_account()
client.authenticate_with_account(account)

# if you're in an environment without accounts, you can construct an Account object yourself
# or authenticate with just a token
# client.authenticate_with_token("YOUR_TOKEN")
```

Now that you have an authenticated client, you can start interacting with the API. Let's create a new stream and get that stream back.

```py
# create a new stream. this returns the stream id
new_stream_id = client.stream.create(name="a shiny new stream")

# use that stream id to get the stream from the server
new_stream = client.stream.get(id=new_stream_id)
```

Next, we'll need some data to send. Let's extend `Base` to create a simple block to make it more interesting. All your custom objects should inherit from `Base` to ensure that serialization will work as expected.

```py
from specklepy.objects import Base
from specklepy.objects.geometry import Point

class Block(Base):
    length: float
    width: float
    height: float
    origin: Point = None

    def __init__(self, length=1.0, width=1.0, height=1.0, origin=Point(), **kwargs) -> None:
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        # mark the origin as a detachable attribute
        self.add_detachable_attrs({"origin"})

        self.length = length
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
        self.origin = origin
```

Now let's send a block to the server! To do this, you'll first need to send the object to the stream and get back the object id or hash. You can then use this to create a commit on the stream that references this object.

```py
from specklepy.transports.server import ServerTransport
from specklepy.api import operations

# here's the data you want to send
block = Block(length=2, height=4)

# next create a server transport - this is the vehicle through which you will send and receive
transport = ServerTransport(client=client, stream_id=new_stream_id)

# this serialises the block and sends it to the transport
hash = operations.send(base=block, transports=[transport])

# you can now create a commit on your stream with this object
commid_id = client.commit.create(
    stream_id=new_stream_id, 
    object_id=hash, 
    message="this is a block I made in speckle-py",
    )
```

Tada! You should now have a commit on your stream containing your block. You'll be able to see the commit on the stream page on the web. Receiving an object back is pretty similar to receiving it. You'll generally be using the client to get a commit, then getting the hash to receive from the `referencedObject` attribute on that commit.

```py
# this receives the object back from the transport.
# the received data will be deserialised back into a `Block` 
received_base = operations.receive(obj_id=hash, remote_transport=transport)
```

### Short Hand: The Stream Wrapper

You've just seen how to simply send and receive objects using the `SpeckleClient` and a `ServerTransport`. Since v2.2.6, you can use a handy helper to get a client and a transport from a stream URL - the `StreamWrapper`!

The `StreamWrapper` can parse any URL pointing to a stream, branch, commit, object, or globals. If you have a local account for the stream you provided, you can get an authenticated client and transport using the helper methods:

```py
from specklepy.api.wrapper import StreamWrapper

# provide any stream, branch, commit, object, or globals url
wrapper = StreamWrapper("https://speckle.xyz/streams/3073b96e86/commits/604bea8cc6")

# get an authenticated SpeckleClient if you have a local account for the server
client = wrapper.get_client()

# get an authenticated ServerTransport if you have a local account for the server
transport = wrapper.get_transport()
```

## Overview of Functionality

### GraphQL Client

The `SpeckleClient` is the entry point for interacting with the GraphQL API. You'll need to have access to a speckle server to use this. To authenticate, you'll need a token. You can either get one from an account you've already added to your computer using the [Manager](/user/manager), or you can head to `your-server.com/profile` and create a Personal Access Token.

```py
from specklepy.api.client import SpeckleClient
from specklepy.api.credentials import get_default_account, get_local_accounts

all_accounts = get_local_accounts() # get back a list
account = get_default_account()

client = SpeckleClient(host="your-server.com") # or whatever your host is
# client = SpeckleClient(host="localhost:3000", use_ssl=False) or use local server

client.authenticate_with_account(account)
```

Interacting with streams is designed to be intuitive and evocative of SpecklePy 1.0

```py
# get a list of your most recent streams
stream_list = client.stream.list()

# search your streams
results = client.stream.search("mech")

# create a stream
new_stream_id = client.stream.create(name="a shiny new stream")

# get a stream
new_stream = client.stream.get(id=new_stream_id)
```

New in 2.0: branches and commits! Here are some basic interactions.

```py
# get list of commits
commits = client.commit.list("stream_id")

# get a specific commit
commit = client.commit.get("stream_id", "commit_id")

# create a commit
commit_id = client.commit.create(
    stream_id="stream_id", object_id="object_id", message="this is a commit message to describe the commit")

# delete a commit
deleted = client.commit.delete("stream_id", "commit_id")

# get a list of branches
branches = client.branch.list("stream_id")

# create a branch
branch_id = client.branch.create("stream_id", "branch name", "a description of the branch")

# get a specific branch
branch = client.branch.get("stream_id", "branch name")

```
### Operations and Transports

The `operations` include four main methods:

1. `send`: send an object to a stream
2. `receive`: receive an object from a stream
3. `serialize`: serialize a given `Base` object
4. `deserialize`: deserializes JSON into an object into the type specified in `speckle_type` (defaults to a vanilla `Base` if the type can't be found)

Let's look at sending and receiving. You will need to provide a `transport` to indicate where the objects should be sent to/received from. When sending, you can provide multiple transports to send the same object to multiple places simultaneously. Currently, we have three types of 'transport': `SQLiteTransport`, `MemoryTransport`, and `ServerTransport`. If you'd like to learn more about Transports in Speckle 2.0, have a look [here](/dev/transports).

```py
from specklepy.transports.memory import MemoryTransport
from specklepy.api import operations

transport = MemoryTransport()
base_obj = Base()

# this serialises the object and sends it to the transport
hash = operations.send(base=base_obj, transports=[transport])

# if the object had detached objects, you can see these as well
saved_objects = transport.objects # a dict with the obj hash as the key

# this receives an object from the given transport, deserialises it,
# and recomposes it into a base object.
# you can optionally provide a local_transport which will default to
# the `SQLiteTransport` pointing at your local cache
received_base = operations.receive(obj_id=hash, remote_transport=transport)
```

You can also use the GraphQL API to send and receive objects. However, note that this method will not recompose a base and will only get the object you explicitly ask for using by its id.

```py
from specklepy.objects import Base
from specklepy.serialization.base_object_serializer import BaseObjectSerializer

# create a test base object
test_base = Base()
test_base.testing = "a test base obj"

# run it through the serialiser
s = BaseObjectSerializer()
hash, obj = s.traverse_base(test_base)

# send it to the server
objCreate = client.object.create(stream_id="stream id", objects=[obj])

received_base = client.object.get("stream id", hash)
```

### Base Object & Serialization

#### The Base Object

The `Base` class is the one you're familiar with from the rest of the Speckle universe. It generally behaves the same way as it does in the other SDKs. For more info about the `Base` object, have a look [here](/dev/base).

```py
from specklepy.objects import Base

# creating a base we will nest within a parent base
detached_base = Base()
detached_base.name = "a detached base"

# creating our parent base object
base_obj = Base()

# attributes can be added using dot or dict notation
base_obj.name = "my base"
base_obj["colour"] = "lilac"

# other base objects can be nested within.
# prepending the attribute name with `@` will detach the nested base when sending
base_obj["@nested"] = detached_base
```

The `Base` class has a few handy instance methods for identifying your object's typed and dynamic attributes:

- `get_typed_member_names()` gets all of the names of the defined (typed) attributes of the object
- `get_dynamic_member_names()` gets all of the names of the dynamic attributes of the object 
- `get_member_names()` gets a list of all the attributes on the object, dynamic or not

Each `Base` object has an `id` (a unique hash) as it does in the other SDKs. This field is only populated if the `Base` has been previously serialized. If you *really* need the hash, you can get it using the `get_id()` method. Be aware that this call will fully serialize the object to create the `id` if the `id` is not populated! By default, the hash will be generated without decomposing the object. However, you can pass `decompose=True` as an argument if you want the decomposed `id`.

#### Subclassing Base

The `Base` class can be subclassed to create your own custom objects. These are automatically added to a class-level registry, simply a dictionary with the type name as the key. The type is automatically populated by the `speckle_type` attribute but can be overwritten when writing your class.

Note that all typed attributes of a class **must be initialized with a non-mutable default value** or a value that you will only change by reassignment. If you'd like mutable defaults, you should write an `__init__` method for the class to set these (see the `Block` example in the first section).

```py
from specklepy.objects import Base
from specklepy.objects.geometry import Point

class Line(Base):
    start: Point = None
    end: Point = None

class AlternativeLine(Base, speckle_type="Line_Two"):
    """
    The `speckle_type` is automatically populated by the class name.
    You can override this behaviour as demonstrated here.
    """
    a: Point = None
    b: Point = None

# look, a new custom line!
line = Line(end=Point(x=1, y=0, z=2))

# adding dynamic attributes as normal
line.blah = "blah"
line["colour"] = "blue"
```

You can also mark typed attributes as detachable or chunkable by updating the internal `_detachable` set or `_chunkable` dict with the provided helper methods.

```py
from specklepy.objects import Base
from typing import List

# members that are chunked upon sending are stored in a dictionary
# with the name as the key and the maximum chunk size as the value
CHUNKABLE_PROPS = {
    "vertices": 1000,
    "faces": 100,
    "colors": 100,
    "textureCoordinates": 100,
    "test_bases": 10,
}

# detachable members are just added to an internal set by name
DETACHABLE = {"detach_this", "origin"}

# you can pass a chunkables dict and a detachables as keyword arguments when writing your class
class FakeMesh(Base, chunkable=CHUNKABLE_PROPS, detachable=DETACHABLE):
    vertices: List[float] = None
    faces: List[int] = None
    colors: List[int] = None
    textureCoordinates: List[float] = None
    test_bases: List[Base] = None
    detach_this: Base = None
    _origin: Point = None

    # properties are also picked up and serialised as you'd expect
    @property
    def origin(self):
        return self._origin

    @origin.setter
    def origin(self, value: Point):
        self._origin = value

```

#### Serialization

The `BaseObjectSerializer` is used behind the scenes in the `operations` for decomposing and serializing `Base` objects so they can be sent/received to the server. You probably won't ever need to use it directly. However, if you want, you can use it to get the id (hash) and a serializable object representation of the decomposed `Base`. You can learn more about the Speckle `Base` object [here](/dev/base) and the decomposition API [here](/dev/decomposition).

```py
from specklepy.objects import Base
from specklepy.serialization.base_object_serializer import BaseObjectSerializer

detached_base = Base()
detached_base.name = "a detached base"

base_obj = Base()
base_obj.name = "my base"
base_obj["@nested"] = detached_base

serializer = BaseObjectSerializer()
hash, obj_dict = serializer.traverse_base(base_obj)

hash, serialized = serializer.write_json(base_obj)
deserialized = serializer.read_json(serialized)
```
